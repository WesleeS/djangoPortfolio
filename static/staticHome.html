            <p>And as Honorable Mentions, although these tend to be pretty specific or subsets of languages, they're still significant enough to be worth mentioning. These are:
                </p><li>Unity (The engine, I started during the C# era)</li>
                <li>Godot (Both the engine and the language)</li>
                <li>Blender</li>
                <li>Git</li>
                <li>Command Line/Batch/Powershell</li>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a self driven Computer Scientist who got their foot in the waters early with a computer at the age of 4. I (obviously) didn't code at 4 years old, it was mostly me getting my first touch, and unless you count the online "Hour of Code" site we had to do in middleschool (which, the experience is nice but... eh?).
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started at the age of 12 with programming, only a little bit of Python, but it had me hooked. When highschool came around, I was eager to take classes. By 16 I had more or less fully started to come into my own, comfortably adept with my assignments and starting to strike into my own waters on things to do. Here I am at 18 writing this, with quite toolbelt to myself and an eternal thanks to the teachers and peers who motivated me to work harder, smarter, and that it's ok to struggle.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapping up with interests; I could mention I play videogames, but you'd be hardpressed to find anyone else my age who never has. I'm a bit of a bland individual whom you might never connect to, but if we got something in common we'll get along great.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do digital art with a tablet and ClipStudioPaint, host tabletop games for Pathfinder 2nd Edition (Currently), FATE Core, GURPS, D&amp;D(3.5,4,5)-- and have been going steady with a long-lived campaign reaching a year and counting.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow! I really could clean up this portfolio page huh. Since creating this for an assignment in an Honors Course (they expected us to make a site on Wix, Squarespace, Google-sites, whatever) it's laid pretty barren. I've kept the "known languages" somewhat up to date, though I could've forgotten something along the lines. I also made this site with, well, a fairly cruddy knowledge of proper architecture concerning websites and I'm experiencing that growing pain of cringing at your own past work. Yikes!
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those curious, I still host that Pathfinder game.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unexpected update! This is a new Django version of my old Blazor site. Made from the ground up! Alot cleaner, and I expect I'll keep updating this one rather than the blazor site hosted on gitpages. Not much different info wise, but I think it's clear how much I've developed my UI and graphics design tastes/skills.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh and still hosting my PF2e game, but now it's on sunday nights rather than saturday mornings.
